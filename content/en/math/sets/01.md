## What's the point of sets?

Set theory is a basis of modern mathematics, and notions of set theory
are used in all formal descriptions. The notion of set is taken as
“undefined”, “primitive”, or “basic”, so we don’t try to define what
a set is, but we can give an informal description, describe important
properties of sets, and give examples. All other notions of mathematics
can be built up based on the notion of set.

## Description

**_Similar (but informal) words:_** $\\,$collection, group, aggregate.

**_Description:_** $\\,$a set is a collection of objects which are
called the members or elements of that set. If we have a set we say
that some objects belong (or do not belong) to this set, are
(or are not) in the set. We also say that sets consist of their elements.

### Examples
- the set of students in this room
- the set of letters of the English language
- the set of natural numbers
- etc.


Sets can therefore consist of elements of various natures:
people, physical objects, numbers, signs, other sets, etc.
(We will use the words object or entity very broadly to include
all these different kinds of things.)

A set is an abstract object; its members do not have to be
physically collected for them to form a set.

In principle, the membership criteria of a set must be well-defined,
and not too vague. If we have a set and an object, it is possible
that we do not know whether this object belongs to the set or not,
because we do not have enough information or knowledge. (E.g. "The
set of students in this room who are older than 18": a well-defined
set but we may not know who is in it). But the answer should exist,
at least in principle. It might be unknown, but it should not be
vague or fuzzy.

> **For example:** Is the letter q the same as the letter Q? Well, that
> depends on which set we consider. If we take the set of 26 letters of
> the English alphabet, then q and Q are the same element. If we take
> the set of 52 upper and lower case letters of the English alphabet,
> then q and Q are two different elements. Both are possible, but we
> need to clarify which set we are talking about so that we know whether
> q = Q or not.

There is exactly one set, the empty set or null set, which has no members at all:

## Specification of sets
There are two essential ways of specifying a set:
1. by listing all elements of the set (list notation);
2. by specifying a property of all its elements (predicate notation).

<br>

> ### 1. List notation
> The list notation is mostly only suitable for finite sets. In this case,
> we enumerate the elements of a set, separate them with commas, and enclose
> them in curly braces.
>
> Examples: $\\{1, 3, 9\\}$, $\\{$red, green, blue$\\}$, $\\{a,b,d,m\\}$
>
> "Three-dots-abbreviation": $\\{1,2,\\,...,100\\}$
>
> We can also specify non-finite sets with the "Three-dots-abbreviation".
> However, it must be clear and comprehensible how the listing continues.
>
> **clear continuation:**\
> the natural numbers: $\\{1,2,3,...\\}$\
> the powers of two: $\\{1,2,4,8,16,32,...\\}$\
> the negative integers: $\\{...,-3,-2,-1\\}$
>
> **unclear continuation:**\
> $\\{3,4,17,...\\}$\
> $\\{0,3,11,64,...\\}$

<div id="midbox" style="margin: 46px 0;">
<p>

> Note that we don't care about the order of elements and
> that elements can be listed multiple times. $\\{1, 3, 9\\}$,
> $\\{9, 3, 1,3\\}$ and $\\{3,9, 3,1\\}$ are different representations
> of the same set.

</p>
</div>

> ### 2. Predicate notation
> Predicate notation defines a set of all objects satisfying a certain
> property $A(x)$. One writes $M = \\{x\\,|\\,A(x)\\}$ and means by this
> the set $M$ of all objects $x$, which satisfy the property $A(x)$.
>
> Instead of a vertical bar, a colon is often used. That way
> $\\{x\\,:\\,A(x)\\}$ can also be written for the set $M$. The
> expression $\\{x\\,:\\,A(x)\\}$ is read as: "_the set of all_
> $\\,x$ _with_ $A(x)$" Some examples follow:
>
> The set of all prime numbers :
> <div id="midbox" style="margin: -12px 0 46px 0">
> <p>
>
> > $\\{x : x$ is a prime number$\\}$
>
> </p>
> </div>
>
> The set of all real numbers between $-3$ and $5$ :
> <div id="midbox" style="margin: -12px 0 46px 0">
> <p>
>
> > $\\{y \in \R: -3 \lt y \lt 5\\}$
>
> </p>
> </div>
>
> The set of all odd natural numbers :
> <div id="midbox" style="margin: -12px 0 46px 0">
> <p>
>
> > $\\{z \in \N: \exists k \in \N: z = 2k-1\\}$
>
> </p>
> </div>
>
> Unlike the list notation, this set notation is also clear
> for non-finite sets. Therefore, for non-finite sets, this
> set notation should be used primarily.
